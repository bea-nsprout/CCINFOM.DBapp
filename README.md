## Tech stack

We are using React for our front end, Vite as ... something, Express.js for our server, mysql for database.

## Running App

First install `node`. Then install packages using
```bash
npm install
```


For development, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs `nodemon` for the server and `vite` for the frontend. Any changes will refresh the server or the front end if there are any changes made.
